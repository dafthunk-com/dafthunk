          In Dafthunk, Nodes are the fundamental units of any workflow. Each
          node represents a specific operation, function, or action. By
          connecting these nodes, you visually design the logic and data flow of
          your automated processes. They are the essential components that make
          visual programming in Dafthunk powerful and intuitive.

        <h2 id="node-anatomy">Anatomy of a Node</h2>
        <p>
          Each node in Dafthunk, regardless of its specific function, shares a
          common structure designed for clarity and ease of use. Understanding
          this anatomy is key to effectively building workflows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Inputs:</strong> These are the connection points where data
            or control signals enter the node. Nodes can have multiple inputs,
            each expecting a specific type of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Outputs:</strong> These are connection points from which
            data or signals exit the node after processing. The results of a
            node's operation are passed to other nodes through its outputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Parameters:</strong> These are configurable settings that
            allow you to customize the behavior of a node. Parameters might
            include API keys, specific values for operations, or choices that
            dictate how the node functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tag:</strong> Nodes are grouped into tags (e.g., AI & ML,
            Text, Data) based on their primary function, making them easier to
            find and understand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Information detailing which types of
            workflows or environments support the specific node.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="node-categories">Node Categories</h2>
        <p>
          To help you navigate the extensive library, nodes are organized into
          logical categories based on their core functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>AI & ML:</strong> Leverage powerful language models, image
            generation capabilities, and other machine learning tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Text:</strong> Perform a wide range of text processing
            tasks, including formatting, extraction, and manipulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Image:</strong> Tools for image generation, analysis,
            conversion, and transformation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Audio:</strong> Nodes for speech processing, audio
            synthesis, and other sound-related manipulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Network:</strong> Make HTTP requests, scrape web content,
            and integrate with various external APIs and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data:</strong> Process, transform, and manipulate data
            structures like JSON, XML, and CSV.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Math:</strong> Perform mathematical operations,
            calculations, and logical comparisons.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Parameters:</strong> Specialized nodes for handling inputs,
            form data, and workflow arguments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email:</strong> Send and process emails, enabling automation
            of communication tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Document:</strong> Tools for processing, converting, and
            extracting data from various document formats.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="connecting-nodes">Connecting Nodes</h2>
        <p>
          Workflows come to life by connecting nodes. This process defines how
          data flows and the sequence of operations:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Establish Connections:</strong> Drag from an output port of
            one node to an input port of another. This creates a visual link
            representing the path of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Transmission:</strong> Once connected, data produced by
            an output port automatically flows to the connected input port of
            the subsequent node.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Type Validation:</strong> The system often performs type
            validation to ensure that the data type of an output is compatible
            with the expected input type, preventing errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Execution Order:</strong> The connections form a directed
            graph, which dictates the order in which nodes execute. Dafthunk
            processes nodes based on these dependencies.
          </li>
        </ol>
