# MDX Provider Test

This file demonstrates how our MDXProvider styles **markdown elements** while leaving literal HTML elements unchanged.

## Markdown Elements (Styled)

This paragraph is written in markdown and will be styled by our MDXProvider with proper spacing and typography.

### Lists in Markdown

- This is a markdown list item
- It will have proper styling with bullets
- And appropriate spacing

### Code in Markdown

Here's some `inline code` in markdown that gets styled.

```javascript
// This is a code block in markdown
function hello() {
  return "This will have syntax highlighting and copy button";
}
```

### Tables in Markdown

| Feature  | Markdown   | HTML           |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Styling  | ✅ Styled  | ❌ Unstyled    |
| Provider | ✅ Applied | ❌ Not applied |

## Literal HTML Elements (Unstyled)

<p>
  This paragraph is written as literal HTML and will NOT be styled by the
  MDXProvider. It will use default browser styles.
</p>

<h3>This is a literal HTML heading</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This is a literal HTML list</li>
  <li>It will not have the custom styling</li>
  <li>It remains as plain HTML</li>
</ul>

<code>This is literal HTML inline code without styling</code>

<blockquote>
  This is a literal HTML blockquote that won't get the custom styling.
</blockquote>

## Mixed Content Example

Here's a **markdown paragraph** with emphasis.

<p>
  Here's a <strong>literal HTML paragraph</strong> with emphasis.
</p>

> This is a markdown blockquote that gets styled.

<blockquote>
  This is a literal HTML blockquote that doesn't get styled.
</blockquote>

## Custom Components

<Callout type="note">
  This is a custom Callout component available in our MDXProvider!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  You can use different types: note, warning, tip, danger
</Callout>

<Badge>Custom Badge</Badge>

## External Links

[This markdown link goes to GitHub](https://github.com) and will show an external link icon.

<a href="https://github.com">This HTML link goes to GitHub</a> and won't show an
external link icon.
