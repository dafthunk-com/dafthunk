## Understanding Nodes

Every node in Dafthunk represents a specific operation or function that can be connected together to create powerful workflows. Nodes are the building blocks that make visual programming possible.

### Node Anatomy

Each node consists of:

- **Inputs** - Data or connections coming into the node
- **Outputs** - Results or data flowing out of the node
- **Parameters** - Configuration settings specific to the node
- **Category** - The functional group the node belongs to
- **Compatibility** - Which workflow types support this node

### Node Categories

Nodes are organized into logical categories based on their primary function:

- **AI & ML** - Language models, image generation, and machine learning
- **Text** - Text processing, formatting, and manipulation
- **Image** - Image generation, analysis, and transformation
- **Audio** - Speech processing, synthesis, and audio manipulation
- **Network** - HTTP requests, web scraping, and external integrations
- **Data** - JSON, XML, CSV processing and transformation
- **Math** - Mathematical operations and calculations
- **Parameters** - Input handling and form data processing
- **Email** - Email sending and processing capabilities
- **Document** - Document processing and conversion

### Connecting Nodes

Nodes work together by connecting outputs to inputs:

1. **Drag connections** from output ports to input ports
2. **Data flows** automatically through connected nodes
3. **Type validation** ensures compatible connections
4. **Execution order** is determined by the connection graph

### Best Practices

When working with nodes:

- **Start Simple** - Begin with basic nodes and add complexity gradually
- **Test Frequently** - Use the playground to verify individual node behavior
- **Handle Errors** - Add error handling nodes for robust workflows
- **Document Purpose** - Use descriptive names for nodes and workflows
- **Optimize Performance** - Consider the computational cost of complex nodes

## Common Patterns

### Sequential Processing

```
Input → Transform → Validate → Output
```

### Parallel Processing

```
Input → Split → [Process A, Process B] → Merge → Output
```

### Conditional Logic

```
Input → Condition → [True Path, False Path] → Combine → Output
```

### Data Transformation Pipeline

```
Raw Data → Parse → Clean → Transform → Store
```
