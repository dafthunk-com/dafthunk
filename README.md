A workflow execution platform built on top of the fantastic Cloudflare infrastructure.

![Workflow](./images/workflow.png)

## üîç Overview

[Daf¬∑thunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk) is a powerful, visual workflow automation platform that allows you to create, manage, and execute workflows directly in your browser. Built on Cloudflare's infrastructure, it leverages Cloudflare Workers and Workflows for serverless execution, Cloudflare AI for intelligent processing, and Cloudflare D1, R2, and KV for persistent storage.

The platform features a visual workflow editor built with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/), allowing you to create complex workflows by connecting various node types, including AI-powered nodes for text processing, image classification, and more. Think digital LEGO, but with less risk to your bare feet at 2 AM.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Visual Workflow Editor**: A drag-and-drop interface for creating and editing workflows that makes command-line enthusiasts mildly uncomfortable.
- **AI-Powered Nodes**: Leverage Cloudflare AI for text summarization, sentiment analysis, translation, image classification, audio transcription, image generation, and more.
- **Serverless Execution**: Run workflows on Cloudflare's global network using Cloudflare Workers, where servers are merely a philosophical concept.
- **Live Monitoring**: Watch your workflows succeed, fail, or do something in between, all live with a UI or an API.
- **Persistent Storage**: Save and load execution data from Cloudflare D1 and R2 with reasonable confidence that they'll still be there tomorrow.
- **Triggers & Integrations**: Nothing happens unless something happens. So you can make it happen with HTTP APIs, emails, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Our collection of carefully selected technologies, guaranteed to be outdated by the time you read this:

### Environment

- **pnpm** for fast and efficient package management with workspace support.
- **TypeScript** for static typing and enhanced developer experience.
- **Vitest** for unit and integration testing.
- **Cloudflare** for edge-optimized deployment and performance.

### Backend

- **Hono** for lightweight, expressive REST API development.
- **Cloudflare Workers** for serverless function execution.
- **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite) for database storage.
- **Cloudflare R2** for object storage.
- **Cloudflare AI** for AI model inference.
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations.
- **Zod** for runtime type validation.

### Frontend

- **Vite** as the build tool and dev server for lightning-fast development.
- **React 19** for building interactive user interfaces.
- **React Router v7** for declarative client-side routing.
- **React Flow (@xyflow/react)** for rendering interactive node-based diagrams.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- **shadcn/ui** for headless, accessible component primitives.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- pnpm (v8 or later)
- Cloudflare account with Workers, D1, R2, and AI access
- A reasonable amount of patience

### üíª Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heigvd-software-engineering/workflow.git
   cd workflow
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
   # Edit with custom values
   ```

4. Create a Cloudflare account and login with Wrangler, a process that's almost as straightforward as it sounds:

   ```bash
   # Install Wrangler globally
   npm install -g wrangler

   # Login to Cloudflare
   wrangler login

   # Create a D1 database
   wrangler d1 create DB
   ```

5. Start the development server and cross your fingers:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Prepare to either celebrate or debug.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

### üìÅ Project Structure

A sensible monorepo organization using pnpm workspaces that we all pretend won't change dramatically tomorrow:

- **`apps/api/`** - Cloudflare Workers API backend
  - `/src/routes/` - REST API endpoints
  - `/src/nodes/` - Workflow node implementations (50+ types)
  - `/src/db/` - Database schema and migrations
  - `/src/runtime/` - Workflow execution engine
  - `/src/middleware/` - Custom middleware
- **`apps/web/`** - React frontend application
  - `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
    - `/workflow/` - Visual workflow editor components
    - `/ui/` - Shadcn UI components
  - `/src/pages/` - Application pages and routes
  - `/src/services/` - API service clients
  - `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
  - `/functions/` - Cloudflare Pages functions
- **`packages/types/`** - Shared TypeScript types
- **`packages/utils/`** - Shared TypeScript utilities

### üßë‚Äçüíª Development Commands

#### Root Level Commands

```bash
# Start all services in development mode
pnpm dev

# Build all packages and apps
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type checking across all workspaces
pnpm typecheck

# Linting and formatting
pnpm lint
pnpm format
pnpm fix

# Dependency analysis
pnpm knip
```

#### Workspace-Specific Commands

```bash
# API development
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' dev
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' deploy

# Web development
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/web' dev
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/web' build
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/web' deploy

# Types package
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/types' build
```

### üóÑÔ∏è Database

The project uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) as the database with Drizzle ORM. Migrations are automatically applied when the project is deployed, but you can also apply them manually if you're feeling adventurous:

#### üß™ Development

```bash
# Apply migrations to local database
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:migrate

# Reset local database (dangerous!)
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:reset

# Generate new migrations
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:generate
```

To run queries against the development database:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --local --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
```

#### üö® Production

```bash
# Apply migrations to production
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:prod:migrate

# Reset production database (proceed with extreme caution!)
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:prod:reset
```

To run queries against the production database:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --env production --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';" --remote
```

## üö¢ Deployment

The main branch is deployed automatically to Cloudflare using GitHub Actions:

- **Frontend**: Deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- **Backend**: Deployed to Cloudflare Workers
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 with automatic migrations
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for file storage

Manual deployment commands:

```bash
# Deploy API to Cloudflare Workers
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' deploy

# Deploy web app to Cloudflare Pages
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/web' deploy
```

## üôè Acknowledgements

We've embraced the AI future before being deprecated (or obliterated?), but we still do the important bits ourselves (like architecture, blablabla, etc.). Right?

üéµ _I kissed an AI and I liked it, hope my dev team doesn't mind it. It felt so wrong, it felt so right‚Äîdoesn't mean I'm coding tonight._ üéµ
