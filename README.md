# Dafthunk

> Break it, fix it, prompt it, automatic, automatic, ...

A workflow execution platform built on top of the fantastic Cloudflare infrastructure.

![Workflow](./images/workflow.png)

## 🔍 Overview

[Daf·thunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk) is a powerful, visual workflow automation platform that allows you to create, manage, and execute workflows directly in your browser. Built on Cloudflare's infrastructure, it leverages Cloudflare Workers and Workflows for serverless execution, Cloudflare AI for intelligent processing, and Cloudflare D1, R2, and KV for persistent storage.

The platform features a visual workflow editor built with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/), allowing you to create complex workflows by connecting various node types, including AI-powered nodes for text processing, image classification, and more. Think digital LEGO, but with less risk to your bare feet at 2 AM.

## ✨ Features

- **Visual Workflow Editor**: A drag-and-drop interface for creating and editing workflows that makes command-line enthusiasts mildly uncomfortable.
- **AI-Powered Nodes**: Leverage Cloudflare AI for text summarization, sentiment analysis, translation, image classification, audio transcription, image generation, and more.
- **Serverless Execution**: Run workflows on Cloudflare's global network using Cloudflare Workers, where servers are merely a philosophical concept.
- **Live Monitoring**: Watch your workflows succeed, fail, or do something in between, all live with a UI or an API.
- **Persistent Storage**: Save and load execution data from Cloudflare D1 and R2 with reasonable confidence that they'll still be there tomorrow.
- **Triggers & Integrations**: Nothing happens unless something happens. So you can make it happen with HTTP APIs, emails, and more.

6. Create a Cloudflare account and login with Wrangler, a process that's almost as straightforward as it sounds:

   ```bash
   # Install Wrangler globally
   npm install -g wrangler

   # Login to Cloudflare
   wrangler login

   # Create a D1 database
   wrangler d1 create DB
   ```

7. Apply the database migration files

   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

8. Start the development server and cross your fingers:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

9. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Prepare to either celebrate or debug.

  - `/src/routes/` - REST API endpoints
  - `/src/nodes/` - Workflow node implementations (50+ types)
  - `/src/db/` - Database schema and migrations

### 🧑‍💻 Development Commands

#### Root Level Commands

```bash
# Start all services in development mode
pnpm dev

# Build all packages and apps
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type checking across all workspaces
pnpm typecheck

# Linting and formatting
pnpm lint
pnpm format
pnpm fix

# Dependency analysis

```

#### Workspace-Specific Commands

```bash
# API development
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' dev
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' deploy

# Web development
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/web' dev
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/web' build
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/web' deploy

# Types package
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/types' build
```

### 🗄️ Database

The project uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) as the database with Drizzle ORM. Migrations are automatically applied when the project is deployed, but you can also apply them manually if you're feeling adventurous:

#### 🧪 Development

```bash
# Apply migrations to local database
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:migrate

# Reset local database (dangerous!)
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:reset

# Generate new migrations
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:generate
```

To run queries against the development database:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --local --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
```

#### 🚨 Production

```bash
# Apply migrations to production
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:prod:migrate

# Reset production database (proceed with extreme caution!)
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' db:prod:reset
```

To run queries against the production database:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --env production --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';" --remote
```

## 🚢 Deployment

The main branch is deployed automatically to Cloudflare using GitHub Actions:

- **Frontend**: Deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- **Backend**: Deployed to Cloudflare Workers
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 with automatic migrations
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for file storage

### Required Production Secrets

Before deploying to production, you must set up secrets for Analytics Engine:

#### 1. Create a Cloudflare API Token

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Use "Create Custom Token"
4. Set permissions: **Account → Analytics → Read**
5. Click "Continue to summary" → "Create Token"
6. Copy the token (you'll only see it once)

#### 2. Set Secrets in Production

```bash
# Set your Cloudflare Account ID (find it at https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
echo "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" | pnpm wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID --env production

# Set your Cloudflare API Token (created above)
echo "YOUR_API_TOKEN" | pnpm wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN --env production
```

These secrets are required for the execution dashboard to query Analytics Engine for workflow execution metrics.

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Deploy API to Cloudflare Workers
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api' deploy

# Deploy web app to Cloudflare Pages
pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/web' deploy
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

We've embraced the AI future before being deprecated (or obliterated?), but we still do the important bits ourselves (like architecture, blablabla, etc.). Right?

🎵 _I kissed an AI and I liked it, hope my dev team doesn't mind it. It felt so wrong, it felt so right—doesn't mean I'm coding tonight._ 🎵
