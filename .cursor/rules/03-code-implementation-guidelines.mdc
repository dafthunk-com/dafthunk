#### General

- Write **correct, DRY, bug-free** code; leave **no TODOs**.  
- Prefer functional components & hooks; use TypeScript types/interfaces everywhere.  
- Early-return to reduce nesting; use descriptive names.

#### Typing

- Use **strict TypeScript**; no `any`, `unknown`, or implicit `any`.  
- Prefer **types** (`type`) over **interfaces** unless extending is needed.  
- Always type props, state, event handlers, and returned values explicitly.  
- Favor **readonly** and **const assertions** (`as const`) where appropriate.  
- Narrow types as much as possible (e.g., specific string literals instead of `string`).  
- Use utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, etc.) thoughtfully to enhance type safety.

#### Styling

- Style exclusively with **Tailwind classes**; never external CSS files.  
- Use the `cn` helper from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes (avoid ternaries).

#### Naming conventions

- Kebab-case file names for components.  
- camelCase for hooks (`useX`) and utilities.  
- Prefix event handlers with `handle` (e.g. `handleClick`).

#### Testing & QA

- Write comprehensive tests in **Vitest**; cover critical paths and edge cases.  
- Supply error handling & fallback UI.
