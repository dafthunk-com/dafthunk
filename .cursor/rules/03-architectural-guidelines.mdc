#### Philosophy

- **Least complexity**: choose the simplest solution that satisfies the requirement.  
- Separate UI, business logic, and data concerns clearly.  
- Design for extensibility but avoid premature abstraction.

#### State management

- Prefer local component state; use context or external stores **only when needed**.

#### Error boundaries

- Provide React error boundaries and fallback UI to shield the user from crashes.
