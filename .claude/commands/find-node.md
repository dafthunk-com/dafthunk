description: Find nodes by functionality or category
---

Help me find a node:

1. Ask me what functionality I'm looking for
2. Search through the node implementations in `apps/api/src/nodes/`
3. Check node registries for matching capabilities
4. List relevant nodes with:
   - Category and name
   - Brief description
   - File location
   - Key features
5. Ask if I want details on any specific node
