description: Run API tests with options
---

Run API tests:

1. Ask me which tests to run:
   - All unit tests
   - Integration tests only
   - Specific file or pattern
   - Specific node category

2. Run the appropriate test command using `pnpm --filter '@dafthunk/api'`
3. If there are failures, analyze them and suggest fixes
