Explain a workflow node:

1. Ask me which node to explain
2. Read the node implementation from `apps/api/src/nodes/`
3. Explain:
   - What the node does
   - Input parameters and their types
   - Output format
   - Any external dependencies (AI models, APIs, etc.)
   - How it integrates with the workflow runtime
   - Example use cases
4. Show the registration details from the registry
