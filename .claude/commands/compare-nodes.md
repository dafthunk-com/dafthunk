description: Compare similar nodes and suggest consolidation
---

Compare workflow nodes:

1. Ask me which nodes to compare (or suggest similar ones)
2. Read both node implementations
3. Compare:
   - Functionality and use cases
   - Input/output schemas
   - Implementation approach
   - Code duplication
4. Identify:
   - Shared logic that could be extracted
   - Opportunities for consolidation
   - Differences in behavior
5. Suggest refactoring to reduce duplication while maintaining functionality
