description: Create a new workflow node type
---

Help me create a new workflow node:

1. Ask me for the node name, category, and what it should do
2. Create the node implementation file in `apps/api/src/nodes/{category}/{node-name}.ts`
3. Follow the existing node patterns (check similar nodes in the category)
4. Register it in the appropriate registry file
5. Add the type definition to `packages/types` if needed
6. Create a basic test file
7. Show me how to test it
