description: Refactor a node following best practices
---

Refactor a workflow node:

1. Ask me which node to refactor and what improvements are needed
2. Read the current implementation
3. Refactor following CLAUDE.md principles:
   - Simplify the interface
   - Reduce complexity
   - Improve type safety
   - Better error handling
   - Add/improve tests
4. Ensure backward compatibility or migration path
5. Update any dependent code
6. Run tests to verify the refactor
